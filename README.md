A Java based chess engine application from scratch.

## Introduction
This project will explore and develop a chess engine (automated opponent) that can play with a user over a chess board in the form of a graphical user interface. It shall be able to participate in a complete chess match playing as both colors and follow the rules, as well as be able to declare different states of the game (checkmate, stalemate). 

It shall also take a reasonably small amount of time to respond to opponent moves, such that it is not unenjoyable to play with the software. 
The GUI that is played on shall adhere to the standard chess board. The chess engine shall be able to consistently win as both colors against another automated chess engine that is rated 1000 elo or more. This application shall be platform independent (modern Windows, macOS, Linux)
### Definitions and Acronyms
* GUI: Graphical User Interface
* elo: standard chess rating system (https://www.chess.com/terms/elo-rating-chess)

## Process Description
### System Requirements
This phase will involve internal discussion and feedback from the professor and others on how to quantify the 'enjoyability' of the application. response times, visual design, GUI reactions, etc will be considered and created as requirements to test.
